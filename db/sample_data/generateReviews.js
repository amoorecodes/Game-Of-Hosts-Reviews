    `We were in town for two weeks and have decided to go with ${this.name} property. It was our first time renting online. `,
    `My brother and I have decided to escape our families for the sake of saving the marriage. `,
    `It was a long childhood dream of mine to escape my hometown. But I didn't want to stay in a hotel. Why would I? `,
    `I used to live in a forest but civilization has got to me. I now live in a forest too, but I used too, too. Anyhow, `,
    `It was a long awaited trip. I was skeptical that place would not be what it looks like in the pictures. `,
    `What a wonderful stay it was! `,
    `This is my first review. `,

    `The house is very warm, welcoming and has all necesities one may need! I especially like the bed. Sorry for the stains. `,
    `Overall it was a positive experience. We had an issue with the kitchen being not very well suited for producing Big Macs, oh well. Overall it was decent. `,
    `The house was quite secluded and no neighbors were bothering me and my company. Extra big garage and jigsaw available onsite was a nice addition. `,
    `I was here for a business trip and hence why a charge on my credit card and not on business account. Overall it was nice and many extra bedding goes a long way. `,
    `Windows were big, bathroom is clean and they even left some wine for us. Sadly it was open and dated. `, 
    `Floors were good. Wallpaint was fresh. Furniture is nice. I mean, I would have bought it. `,
    `The place was spacious and very well equipped. `,
    `Very well kept place. It was very clean when we have arrived, the shelves were stocked with toilettes and they even left us some fruits on the table. `,
    `Great house. We were very happy with it. `,
    `We were't looking for beds to sleep on. We had only 3 days in the city and a bag full of money. We could of just slept on a pile of cash if we wanted. Double metal doors were nice. `

      `The kitchen had grease all over. There were dirty dishes eveywhere. Beds had stained sheets. Should I even continue? `,
      `There was a dog inside the house. An actual dog. It beat me on the arm and I had to sleep outside in a carton. `,
      `Bedbugs. Bedbugs everywhere! I brought them home with me, too. Bites, bites, and more bites! `,
