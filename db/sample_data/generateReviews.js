      `I rented this property very last minute but ${this.name} was manage to accomodate me! `,
      `We were in town for two weeks and have decided to go with ${this.name} property. It was our first time renting online. `,
      `My brother and I have decided to escape our families for the sake of saving the marriage. `,
      `It was a long childhood dream of mine to escape my hometown. But I didn't want to stay in a hotel. Why would I? `,
      `I used to live in a forest but civilization has got to me. I now live in a forest too, but I used too, too. Anyhow, `,
      `It was a long awaited trip. I was skeptical that place would not be what it looks like in the pictures. `,
      `What a wonderful stay it was! `,
      `This is my first review. `,

      `The house is very warm, welcoming and has all necesities one may need! I especially like the bed. Sorry for the stains. `,
      `Overall it was a positive experience. We had an issue with the kitchen being not very well suited for producing Big Macs, oh well. Overall it was decent. `,
      `The house was quite secluded and no neighbors were bothering me and my company. Extra big garage and jigsaw available onsite was a nice addition. `,
      `I was here for a business trip and hence why a charge on my credit card and not on business account. Overall it was nice and many extra bedding goes a long way. `,
      `Windows were big, bathroom is clean and they even left some wine for us. Sadly it was open and dated. `,
      `Floors were good. Wallpaint was fresh. Furniture is nice. I mean, I would have bought it. `,
      `The place was spacious and very well equipped. `,
      `Very well kept place. It was very clean when we have arrived, the shelves were stocked with toilettes and they even left us some fruits on the table. `,
      `Great house. We were very happy with it. `,
      `We were't looking for beds to sleep on. We had only 3 days in the city and a bag full of money. We could of just slept on a pile of cash if we wanted. Double metal doors were nice. `

      `There was literally no floors! Host has sent contractors to finish their work while we were there. They just came in and ripped out the floors exposing us to basement. What were we suppose to do? `,
      `The kitchen had grease all over. There were dirty dishes eveywhere. Beds had stained sheets. Should I even continue? `,
      `There was a dog inside the house. An actual dog. It beat me on the arm and I had to sleep outside in a carton. `,
      `Bedbugs. Bedbugs everywhere! I brought them home with me, too. Bites, bites, and more bites! `,
